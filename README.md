Work with professionals, find your flight
=========================================

I was looking for flights back to Germany and have got the impression that somehow I'm not as successful as I would like to be.

Given that I'm booking three months in advance and I'm not tied to a specific date, route or airline, there should be some pretty inexpensive flights from Sydney to Nuremberg or at least to Frankfurt. 

But the cheapest that I could find was $920 via Beijing with Air China which I did not consider as a nice option. Next to that a pretty convenient option via Kuala Lumpur about $1470.

It seems to me like there must be other options that are just hiding from my aged eyes. I was using <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com" title="hipmunk" target="_blank">www.hipmunk.com</a>, which I like a lot for it's very convenient user interface and great sorting options. 

But there must be something else! And it is. A <a href="http://www.longtimeout.com/2012/05/18/ausschreibungsplattform-fuer-flugsuchen/" title="Ausschreibungsplattform fÃ¼r Flugsuchen" target="_blank">blog post from Julian</a> came to mind. So I decided to use the experience of an expert. I like to ask an expert. Of course as I am an expert in my profession and work as consultant. So this is daily business. 

Therefore I launched a flight contest for $44. You can get the contest launched for less, but I decided to pay more because I think experts shouldn't work for cheap. You can <a href="https://flightfox.com/?referral=49456" title="Flightfox" target="_blank">launch your contest and get a 25% discount</a> if you want to.

<strong>Here are my findings how good this works</strong>

First of all, it's only worth the effort if the flight your looking for is more than just from NUE to TXL or whatever other simple thing. But I was aiming for a good affordable way to get the family from Australia to southern Germany with a nice layover maybe.

<strong>Part 1:</strong>

Pretty fast, one of the experts came up with a flight from Sydney to Singapore (1st layover) to Riyadh to London (2nd layover) to Nuremberg. This option had a amazing price tag of $614 per person. But sadly on further inspection it did not quite match my expectations in terms of quality. I have opted "I'll pay moe for better airlines". The airlines on this offer where the ones with the worst ratings available. I can absolutely stand this if it's for a short flight, but not over the long haul like from Singapore to London with a stop over of more than 6 hours.

Actually I didn't realized this until I hired that expert (which is the way of saying: "this guy shall get the money" at Flightfox) and booked the last leg of that offer (yes, you still book your flights on your own at Flightfox). But as I booked the cheap Ryanair flight from London to Nuremberg and was about to book the Saudi Arabian Airlines flight, it got pretty bad. During booking I was asked to give an address in London which I didn't had at that time. I have to say this saved me from booking that Airline and that I looked up some reviews at this point with showed me how embarrassing that airline seems to be. I ended up asking the expert for another option and expressed my concerns regarding Saudi Air and that 6 hour stop over. But this time the expert was not nearly as fast as with the first offer. A day later I switched experts and moved from RDX to Bloodhound (experts are nicknamed at Flightfox).

<strong>Part 2:</strong>

The second expert offered a pretty good setup in the first place. He found flights from Sydney to Singapore (layover) to Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt for $810 per person. At this time, as I've already booked the flight from London to Nuremberg I asked him to help me finding a setup that includes this. He answered right away and found a connecting flight with Malaysian Airlines from Singapore to London.

All set! 

I booked the flights and after that the other expert got back to me with the same flight plan that I've already booked announcing it for $688.

The flights where not as cheap as shown on Flightfox, but I still got a deal way better than what I was able to find on my own. 

<strong>Why are the prices different from what the experts say?</strong>

To be selected, the experts have to compete with each other. One very important measurement for the customer is the price. I think that's the reason why some (maybe all) experts just don't add costs that they should add. In my case this was extra luggage on the low-cost airlines Scoot and Ryanair. In addition to that, I selected premium seats ($50) for the Kuala Lumpur to London flight which is arguable for sure.

All in all, I've paid $875 per person which is $137 more than advertised by the expert, but still $595 less than what I came up with without help. 

That's what I call a good advise from an expert, even if there is room for improvement. And that's why I'm happy to pay for this advise.

I wish you a good flight next time you get to it!

Cheers,
Birger
